# Room Signs

Room signs are a pretty simple part of Design at OMUN. They're used as large foam boards, designed to be held by each committee's dais to guide delegates to their rooms and to place outside of their room. Room Signs are large, being printed on a 24" by 36" foam board. Generally, the Room Signs are a simple design, and other than data merge no changes need to be made to its design.

Room Signs are expensive and non-reusable, and are non-essential to the conference. If budget cuts need to be made, Room Signs should be the first material to look at.

### Data Merge

Room Signs are made with Adobe InDesign using Data Merge - anybody looking to make Room Signs should familiarize themselves with its features. 

Room signs take in three Data Inputs:

| Data Entry | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| Room Number | 223 |
| Committee Short Name | AL |
| Committee Long Name | Arab League |
