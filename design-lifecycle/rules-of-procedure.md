# Rules of Procedure

The Rules of Procedure is standard for any conference - it explains the intricacies of MUN to any beginner or veteran looking to get themselves acquainted with Model UN. While it's very important, it's also very easy to produce \(from a design standpoint\) - it is simply black on white text that doesn't typically change from year to year.

In theory, this should be made in Adobe InDesign \(and it traditionally has been\), though its simplicity means that it can be made in whatever software is comfortable \(e.g. a word processor\). The separation from the Delegate Guide allows OMUN to cut down on costs and only distribute it when needed. Unlike the Delegate Guide, no spreads are used, so it can be sent in just to be straight-printed and stapled - which greatly minimizes the costs.

### Example

Here's the Rules of Procedure as of OMUN III \(2018\) - but by no means is it final. Change it as needed!
