# Tools

There isn't a single set of "must-have" tools that every designer at OMUN needs, but there are sets of tools that make designing easy. In addition, many of the templates that OMUN builds its design off of were made in specific softwares: in those scenarios, designers will have to use that software.

#### A Note on Software Versioning {#a-note-on-software-versioning}

In the wide majority of cases, OMUN will simply use the latest stable version of respective software. However, with some software \(most notably Adobe software\), this is not feasible from a budgetary or technological perspective. Therefore, we always recommend saving copies of files in backwards-compatible file formats, and coordinating with other members of the design team on software versions. This is especially a problem when handing off files from major Adobe versions, such as Photoshop CC to Photoshop CS5.

## General Purpose Tools {#general-purpose-tools}

These tools are essential for most designers, mostly because they can perform basic image operations that any designer \(graphic, video, web, otherwise\) will have to use. Getting familiar with these tools makes the WAC design workflow simple.

### Adobe Photoshop {#adobe-photoshop}

Photoshop is the definition of a designer's "Swiss Army Knife". It's useful in manipulating images, creating quick mockups, and applying special effects to designs. We suggest that any designer gets familiar with Photoshop \(or a free alternative, such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)\), as it will pay dividends in the future.

Photoshop is often used to create "one-of" designs that are minimal in nature, such as Social Media content, notepads, or signage, as well as quick edits to existing materials. For designs that are specifically made to print \(such as Packages, Placards, or Nametags\), we recommend that you use InDesign. For more complicated designs, we recommend that you use Illustrator.

Students can talk to their OMUN supervisor to get a license for the Adobe Suite, which includes Photoshop.

### Adobe InDesign {#adobe-indesign}

InDesign is the software that we use to make complex ready-to-print materials, specifically the Delegate Package, Nametags, Placards, Room Signs, and Rules of Procedure. InDesign is great at creating layouts for multi-page designs, using data to generate data-based materials \(i.e. nametags\), and generally making documents that are ready to print. Using InDesign is a breeze if one is already familiar with Photoshop and/or Illustrator.

## Specialist Tools

### Adobe Illustrator {#adobe-illustrator}

Illustrator is a good companion to Photoshop, filling in the gaps where Photoshop is lacking. It's useful in creating vectors and other illustrations, and unlike Photoshop it can export to SVG. Knowing the basics of using Illustrator can go a long way in expanding a designer's general skills. However, Illustrator is not integral to any part of OMUN, as there aren't many logos or designs that change significantly year to year.

### Code Editor \([Atom](https://atom.io/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\) {#code-editor-atom-brackets-sublime-vscode}

Coding is a really useful tool skill to have in a wide variety of jobs, and design is no exception. All of web design/development hinges on using code, and coding also comes in handy when manipulating swathes of data or doing checks on human work. While OMUN doesn't have a preferred editor there is a plethora of editors available online. Since most of our work is with web development and light data work, your editor needs to support Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.

### [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)​ {#github-desktop}

GitHub Desktop is an open-source visual Git client made by GitHub. It can help simplify the coding workflow and keep version control easy in the many coding operations that happen at OMUN.

### [Nik Collection](https://nikcollection.dxo.com/)​ {#nik-collection}

The Nik Collection is a super useful \(albeit niche\) free piece of software that can make photos more vibrant. We've used the Nik Collection to apply filters on photos used on printed materials.

### [Svgsus](http://www.svgs.us/)​ {#svgsus}

Svgsus is a useful tool that helps designers organize and manipulate their SVG libraries \(e.g. Font Awesome, Material Design Icons, Octicons\).
